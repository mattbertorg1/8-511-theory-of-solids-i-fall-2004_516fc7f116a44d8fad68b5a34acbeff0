description: 'The effect of a ?ux tube through the center of a ring is described.
  We show that a gauge

  transforming which removes the ?ux tube is equivalent to a modification of the periodic

  boundary condition.The Laughlin argument for the integer quantum Hall effect is
  given. The Halperin picture of edge states is explained in some detail,leading to
  an estimate that corrections to the quantization of the Hall resistance is exponentially
  small in the sample width.'
