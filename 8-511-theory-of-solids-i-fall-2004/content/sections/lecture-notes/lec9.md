description: 'In this lecture the tight binding method is formulated and its relation
  to the chemist''s notion of molecular orbital emphasized, hence the name LCAO, linear
  combination of atomic orbitals. An

  example involving s and p orbitals is given. The density of states is defined and
  van Hove singularity identified.'
